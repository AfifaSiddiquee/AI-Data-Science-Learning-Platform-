## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this platform is to deliver an inclusive and effective learning environment for AI and Data Science learners. It incorporates multimedia lessons, personalized learning paths, and practical simulations to create a hands-on educational experience.

### 1.2 Platform Features and Objectives  
- **Adaptive Learning Paths**: Personalized course recommendations based on user goals and performance.  
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time tracking of lessons, quizzes, and module completions.  
- **Interactive Elements**: Quizzes, simulations, and discussion forums for active engagement.  
- **Content Management System (CMS)**: Allows non-technical instructors to upload and manage content.  
- **Accessibility and Scalability**: Optimized for users with disabilities and scalable for high user traffic.  

### 1.3 Development Approach  
The platform is being developed using the **Agile methodology**, with feature releases organized in iterative sprints. Agile allows for flexibility, continuous feedback, and fast adaptation to user needs. Accessibility testing is embedded within each sprint.
